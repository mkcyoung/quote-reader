My final project for Harvard's CS50 course. A web application designed to first convert pictures of words to text, then store this text in a database under the book name and specific page number.

Some highlights include:
Usage of OpenCV software to convert images of text to strings
SQL to handle the database 
A Bootstrap-beautified web interface

(8/22/18) - I'll add a more in-depth description as well as instructions on how to download and install all of the 
relevant software at a later date.
